      Alien Signals is a high-performance reactive programming system for Lua,
      ported from stackblitz/alien-signals.

      It provides automatic dependency tracking and efficient update propagation
      through a small and powerful API.

      Core features:
      - Signal: mutable reactive values
      - Computed: derived values with caching
      - Effect: side effects that re-run when dependencies change
      - EffectScope: group and dispose multiple effects
      - Batch: efficient bulk state updates
      - Watch: observe reactive value changes
